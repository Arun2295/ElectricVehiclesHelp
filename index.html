            <h2>Why Electric Vehicles?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are a crucial part of our journey towards a sustainable and eco-friendly future. By choosing electric vehicles, we contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Benefits of Electric Vehicles</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, helping to improve air quality and combat climate change.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Over time, electric vehicles can be more cost-effective due to lower maintenance and fuel costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> EVs are generally more energy-efficient than traditional vehicles, making better use of resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Government Incentives:</strong> Many governments offer incentives such as tax credits and rebates to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>Join the Electric Revolution</h2>
            <p>Make a positive impact on the environment and your wallet by choosing electric vehicles. Embrace the future of transportation and be a part of the electric revolution!</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                This Website is dedicated to identifying and solving problems faced by Electric vehicles.
                We believe that for a sustainable future where we use as much clean energy as possible, the advent 
                of electric vehicles becomes vital and in that spirit we have made this website. We as 
                students can only do so much for this cause but we are taking a first step by creating this 
                website. One of the major problems faced by Electric vehicles are lack of charging stations 
                and not being able to find charging spots at the right time. If you go to the maps section
                of this page you can search for nearby charging station using your current location or by 
                manually entering the city you are in or any landmark near you.

            <h2>Issues to be Addressed</h2>
            <div class="issue_div1">
                <h3>1. Limited Range</h3> 
                <p>The range of an EV on huge concern for users. While many companies have been improving the ranges with advancements in battery technology it is still one of the negatives of EVs. This causes a phenomenon  called range anxiety due to which people avoid buying EVs.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="issue_div2">
                <h3>2. Charging Infrastructure</h3> 
                <p>The availability and accessibility of charging stations can be a major obstacle, particularly in rural or less developed areas. Charging infrastructure needs to expand to make EVs more practical for all consumers.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="issue_div1">
                <h3>3. Charging Time</h3>
                <p>Charging an electric vehicle takes longer than filling up a petrol,  diesel or CNG vehicle. There is a urgent need for new advanced charging technology that can reduce the charging time.</p>
